INHERITANCE BASED PROGRAMS REPOSITORY: 


📌 Overview:
This repository contains Java programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Each program showcases an essential OOP principle through practical implementations.

📂 Programs Included:

🔹 Area of Circle
Calculates the area of a circle using a coordinate-based approach.

Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding.

🔹 Employee Salary
Simulates an employee salary system with overtime calculations.

Implements inheritance where a subclass extends a base employee class.

🔹 Factorial Sum
Computes the factorial sum of numbers using recursion.

🔹 Hierarchical Inheritance
Demonstrates Hierarchical Inheritance, where multiple subclasses (Circ, Rectangle) implement a common interface (Shape).

Showcases polymorphism with different implementations of the area() method.

🔹 Interface
Implements Java Interfaces to achieve abstraction and multiple class implementations.

🔹 Product and Sales
Simulates a product sales system with tax and profit calculations.

Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding for computational methods.
